- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Model Evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

## 📈 Results
